* ### Bugs / problems faced / warnings
  * I havent encountered any bugs that i could see,
  * problems with aliging the videos when previewing into a smaller screen,fixed by changing size of videos. when 
    viewed on a smaller screen via google developer tools that the drink overlay doesnt show the whole content of the recipe, but i found out that viewing on a smartphone , there is no scrollbar on touchscreens which the issue of not seeing the full content using the developer tools.
  * warnings i have faced was when i checked my CSS code through the jigsaw validator website . It showed this = 
    webkit transform is a vendor extension	ms transform is a vendor extension. I wasnt sure how to fix these     warnings.
